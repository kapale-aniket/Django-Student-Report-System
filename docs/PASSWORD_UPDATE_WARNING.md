# ⚠️ PASSWORD UPDATE - IMPORTANT WARNING

## 📝 What Was Updated:

**Password changed to:** `Aniket#8805286613`

**Updated in:**
- ✅ `.env` file (EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD)

**Note:** The password is only stored in `.env` file. `settings.py` reads from `.env` automatically.

---

## ⚠️ WARNING - This May Still Not Work!

### Why This Password Format May Fail:

1. **Length:** 17 characters
   - Gmail App Passwords are exactly **16 characters**

2. **Special Character:** Contains `#`
   - Gmail App Passwords are **alphanumeric only** (letters and numbers)
   - No special characters like `#`, `@`, `!`, etc.

3. **Not a Gmail App Password:**
   - This appears to be a user-created password
   - Gmail requires **App Passwords** generated by Google

---

## ✅ What Gmail App Passwords Look Like:

**Correct Format:**
- `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` (16 characters with spaces)
- `abcdefghijklmnop` (16 characters without spaces)
- **Only letters and numbers** (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- **No special characters**

**Generated by:** Google (via https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

## 🔧 If This Password Doesn't Work:

You'll still get the error:
```
535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
```

**Solution:** You MUST use a Gmail App Password:
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Enable 2-Step Verification first (if not already enabled)
3. Generate a 16-character App Password
4. Update `.env` with that App Password

---

## 📋 Current Configuration:

```env
EMAIL_HOST_USER=aniketkapale75@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=Aniket#8805286613
```

**Test it:** Try creating an evaluator/student and see if email sends.

**If it fails:** You need a Gmail App Password (see GMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

---

## 🎯 Summary:

- ✅ Password updated in `.env` file
- ⚠️ This format may not work with Gmail SMTP
- 🔧 If it fails, use a Gmail App Password (16 chars, alphanumeric only)

**Restart your Django server after this update!**
