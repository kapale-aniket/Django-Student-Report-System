# Student Report Management System

This is a Django-based web application that I built as a learning and academic project to manage student project report submissions and evaluations.

The system supports different user roles and helps automate report submission, review, and basic communication through email.

## What the project does
- Allows students to upload their project reports
- Evaluators can review reports and give feedback
- Admin can manage users and monitor submissions
- Uses role-based access (Admin, Evaluator, Student)

## Tech stack used
- Django (Python)
- MySQL (SQLite for development)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Git & GitHub

## Why I built this project
I built this project to:
- Practice Django fundamentals
- Understand role-based authentication
- Work with file uploads and databases
- Learn how backend systems are structured

## How to run the project locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
4. Configure environment variables using `env.example`
5. Run migrations
6. Start the Django development server

The app will run at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/


- Uploaded files are stored locally during development
